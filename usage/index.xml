      <description>Most of the co-pilot commands operate on some common principles, target, recursive, and dry-run.
Target By default co-pilot operates on the current folder similar to tools like git. However a custom --target flag is available for most commands and enables the used to use co-pilot ... --target outside of the working folder.
Recursive Recursive mode is enabled with --recursive or -r for most commands. This mode starts by building a list of subprojects on the current target, and iteratively working on each subproject.</description>
